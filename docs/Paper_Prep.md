All which has been done so far! Every method, technique, model, programming language, libraries, research paper, scientific literatures. Everything!
Technique:
    Homography is a technique that allows us to convert points in one planar reference frame into another. My technique works on the assumption that Over the area that the camera is observing the GPS readings act as points in a planar surface

Language:
    Python 

Libraries: 
    Google Colab



Papers: 
    [Camera calibration with genetic algorithms](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3412000_Camera_calibration_with_genetic_algorithms)
